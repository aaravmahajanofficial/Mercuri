# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of **Mercuri** seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose it to us. Please follow these guidelines when reporting a vulnerability:

*   **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until I had a chance to address it.
*   **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it, potential impact, and any proof-of-concept code.
*   **Do not exploit the vulnerability** beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it.
*   **Do not engage in any activity that could disrupt my services or compromise user data.**

To report a security vulnerability, please email me at aaravmahajan2003@gmail.com. I aim to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 7 days with information on the next steps.

## Our Commitment

I am committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and transparently. Upon receiving a valid vulnerability report, I will:

1.  **Acknowledge receipt** of your report.
2.  **Investigate the vulnerability** and determine its severity and impact.
3.  **Develop and deploy a fix** as quickly as possible.
4.  **Keep you informed** of my progress towards a resolution.
5.  **Announce the fix** and, where appropriate, credit the reporter for their responsible disclosure.

## Security Updates

I will release security updates and patches as needed to address identified vulnerabilities. I encourage users to keep their installations of `Mercuri` up-to-date to ensure they are protected against the latest known security risks.

## Scope

This security policy applies to `Mercuri` and its associated components. Please report vulnerabilities found within this scope.
